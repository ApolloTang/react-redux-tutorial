# react-tutorial

Each folder is a lesson, you first have to create a node_modules directory
above all lessons [1]:

```sh
mkdir node_modules  
```
You only have create the node_modules/ directory once. After that 
you can go to each lesson directory to run npm install

```sh
cd <lesson-dir>
npm i
```

To play with a lesson, spin up webpack dev server: 

```sh
npm start
```

In browser open up localhost:9999

------------
foot note:
[1] node_modules/ in each lesson is symbolically link to this directory (OSX and Linux).
